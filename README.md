Welcome to JA Github Page!

My name is Junghan An.

I always believe there are better ways to do things. Data analysis can be applied to figure out where to tackle improving sales/margins and efficiencies in processes. Optimization models can be applied to find the best solutions as well.

Data science is not about coding. It is an art. A person who is doing a data science project needs to understand data and dissect data to extract meaningful insights. Also, you need to translate meaningful insights into an easier language to make sure everyone understands. Communicating meaningful insights is a crucial part.

I hope sharing my work and my thought processes would help someone else to make something better.

I am currently working on Optimization Project. I have experience in R and Python. How to reach me: junghan.an@gmail.com

Have fun and enjoy solving problems!
